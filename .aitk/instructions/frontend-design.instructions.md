# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when building web components, pages, or applications. Generate creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
  - Brutally minimal
  - Maximalist chaos
  - Retro-futuristic
  - Organic/natural
  - Luxury/refined
  - Playful/toy-like
  - Editorial/magazine
  - Brutalist/raw
  - Art deco/geometric
  - Soft/pastel
  - Industrial/utilitarian
  - Or create your own unique direction
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Goals

Implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID**: Generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- **USE**: Distinctive choices that elevate aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Make unexpected, characterful font choices

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Vary between light and dark themes across projects

### Motion & Animation
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors
- Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic
- Creative forms to consider:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise textures
  - Geometric patterns
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders
  - Custom cursors
  - Grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER USE)

**AVOID these generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Overused font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- Same design across projects

**IMPORTANT**: Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary aesthetics, fonts, themes across all work.

## Complexity Guidelines

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:

- **Maximalist designs**: Need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist/refined designs**: Need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details

Elegance comes from executing the vision well, regardless of complexity level.

## Remember

Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back - show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
